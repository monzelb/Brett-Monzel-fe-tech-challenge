# FeTechChallenge
Hi!  Welcome to the WSECU Front End Tech Challenge.  This challenge is intended to test your user interface development skills using a pre-bootstrapped single page application.

You may perform the challenge using the following UI frameworks:
- Angular
- More to come in the future...

## Install
Each UI framework has its own separate README.md file.  Please refer to each app's respective README.md for instructions on how to build and run the app.  For example, instructions for building and running the Angular app can be found at angular-app/README.md

Please refer to instructions delivered separately.
